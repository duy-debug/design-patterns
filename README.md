# Software Architecture and Design – Java

This repository contains a **collection of exercises, laboratory assignments, and design pattern implementations** for the **Software Architecture and Design** course, developed using the **Java** programming language.

The content focuses on building a strong **object-oriented programming (OOP) mindset**, understanding **software architecture principles**, and applying **design patterns** to create maintainable and scalable software systems.
